            My current Full time Role is within the Repairs Department of <a
              href="http://www.de-soutter.com/">'De-Soutter Medical'</a>, starting in 2016. This has been a diverse
            role, which has seen me progress from working with the basic mechanical attachments, to the Power Consoles
            and Battery Chargers and finally the ‘Flag Ship’ Electrical Handpieces. The wealth of product expertise I
            have obtained over the years has lead me to be identified as an essential worker by both my manager and
            supervisor. During the initial stages of the pandemic, myself and my supervisor were relied upon to cover
            the workload of our entire department of 9 staff. During this time I am also frequently working with the
            Assembly department to assist them with priority orders and helping them meet production deadlines.

            For the last 3 Rugby Seasons I have been involved with the youth development at my local rugby club. I
            started in 2017 joining the u15 team (now the Colts/u18s team), initially to assist with the development of
            their forwards. As my experience and qualifications grew I progressed into a more expansive role where I
            have
            planned and led full training sessions with up to 25 players when required.
            This team went on to finish 2nd in the Buckinghamshire County Plate final in April 2019 and finished
            undefeated in the <a
              href="https://www.englandrugby.com/fixtures-and-results/search-results?competition=1646&division=25801&season=2019-2020#table">
              ‘OBB U18s Colts Division Two 2019/20’ </a>in the following year.

          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            At present I also work closely with Junior Development at the Rugby club. I am responsible for the
            organisation of the club's 'Master Class'. This involves planning position specific training sessions,
            organising volunteers to assist leading the sessions as well as gathering feedback from the other Junior
            Coaches.

            My remaining spare time is split between personal fitness and study. My fitness pursuits (outside of rugby)
            have been largely focused in the weight room, here I follow an Upper-Lower regime inspired by Jeff Nippard
            which has lead me to significant progress in terms of raw strength. At home I have learned some basics of
            Web Development leading to the creation of this website. I also enjoy reading educational books, my current
            book of choice would be 'Extreme Ownership' by 'Jocko Willink' which teaches about the fundamentals of
            leadership.
